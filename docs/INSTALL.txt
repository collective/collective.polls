Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

    1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.polls``
       to the list of eggs to install ::

        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
            collective.polls


After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'',
which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the
'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ''collective.polls'' and click the 'Activate' button.

Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
