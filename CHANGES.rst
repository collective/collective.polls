Changelog
---------

There's a frood who really knows where his towel is.

1.9b2 (unreleased)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Do not fail while adding a portlet under Plone 5 (closes `#106`_).
  [hvelarde]


1.9b1 (2016-09-29)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Warning::
    This release removes some packages from the list of dependencies.
    Be sure to read the whole changelog and apply the related changes to your buildout configuration while upgrading.
    Also, note that this is the first release marked as compatible with Plone 5;
    it still has some issues and must not be used in production with that version.

- Package is now compatible with Plone 5.0 and Plone 5.1.
  [hvelarde]

- Remove hard dependency on plone.app.referenceablebehavior as Archetypes is no longer the default framework in Plone 5.
  Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add it to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration to avoid issues while upgrading.
  [hvelarde]

- Get rid of the ``uid_for_poll`` function.
  [hvelarde]
